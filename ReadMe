1-DOF DC Motor Speed Control Using Potentiometer(Arduino+L293D)
1. OVERVIEW
This project implements a 1 degree of freedom(rotation only) DC Motor speed control system using:
- Arduino
- L293D motor driver IC
- DC Motor
- Potentiometer 10K
- External Power Supply Module
- Jumper Wires
All of the materials are from Elegoo Super Starter Kit. The motor speed is controlled by varying the voltage across a potentiometer.
The analog voltage is read by the Arduino, processed and converted into a PWM signal that drives the DC motor through the L293D driver.

2. OBJECTIVES
 -To understand analog voltage reading using Arduino ADC and analogRead
 -Implement PWM-based motor speed control 
 -Combine input sensing and motor actuation systems
 -Apply basic signal smoothing using moving average filter
 -Demonstration of integration of hardware and software

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Input Stage: Analog Voltage(5V)->Potentiometer->Analog Voltage(0-5V)->ArduinoADC(A3)
Processing Stage: 10-sample moving average filter->Voltage Scaling(ADC to Volts) -> Voltage to PWM Conversion(0-5V to 0-255)
Output Stage: PWM Signal -> L293D Motor Driver -> DC Motor speed control

5. CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
5.1 Potentiometer Connections:
Left Pin   - 5V from Arduino
Right Pin  - GND
Middle Pin - Arduino A3
This sets up a variable voltage divider between 0V and 5V.

5.2 L293D Connections:
Pin 1(Enable) -> Arduino PWM pin 5
Pin 2(Input1) -> Arduino Pin 13
Pin 7(Input2) -> Arudino Pin 12
L293D Output Pins3 and 6 -> DC Motor 
L293D Motor Supply Pin 8 -> External 5V supply
Common GND shared with Arduino

7. KEY ENGINEERING CONCEPTS APPLIED
7.1 Analog to Digital Conversion(ADC)
Arduino ADC:
- 10 bit resolution
- Range: 0-1023
- Reference voltage: 5V

7.2 Voltage calculation:
V = ADC*5/1023

7.3 Moving Average Filter
Filter used to smooth out noisy analog readings

average = take previous 10 values and divide it by 10 and output the result

7.4 PWM Motor speed control
Arduino PWM:
- Range: 00-255
- Represents duty cycle
Mapping:
PWM = Voltage*255/5

Higher duty cycle = Higher average motor voltage thus resulting in actuation of motor with higher speed

7.5 H-Bridge Control with L293D
- dir 1 HIGH, dir 2 LOW  = forward rotation
- dir 2 HIGH, dir 1 LOW = Backward rotation
- PWM applied to enable pin controls speed

8. OBSERVATIONS
- Motor speed responds proportionally to potentiometer rotation
- Signal smoothing reduces sudden speed jumps
- Incorrect grounding initially caused constant 5V reading
- Motor speed limited when powered by 3.3V, full speed of rotation achieved at 5V

9. CHALLENGES FACED
- Incorrect grounding resulting in constant ADC reading
- PWM Scaling done for 5V but initial mistake connection with 3.3V supply

10. IMPROVEMENTS AND POSSIBLE FUTURE WORK
- Add bidirectional control using potentiometer midpoint
- Implement closed loop control using encoder feedback
- Replace simple mapping with PID control
- Add serial plotter visualization for speed vs voltage
- Replace DC Motor with BLDC for higher level control experiments
