1-DOF DC Motor Speed Control Using Potentiometer(Arduino+L293D)
1. OVERVIEW
This project implements a 1 degree of freedom(rotation only) DC Motor speed control system using:
- Arduino
- L293D motor driver IC
- DC Motor
- Potentiometer 10K
- External Power Supply Module
- Jumper Wires
All of the materials are from Elegoo Super Starter Kit. The motor speed is controlled by varying the voltage across a potentiometer.
The analog voltage is read by the Arduino, processed and converted into a PWM signal that drives the DC motor through the L293D driver.

2. OBJECTIVES
 -To understand analog voltage reading using Arduino ADC and analogRead
 -Implement PWM-based motor speed control 
 -Combine input sensing and motor actuation systems
 -Apply basic signal smoothing using moving average filter
 -Demonstration of integration of hardware and software

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Input Stage: Analog Voltage(5V)->Potentiometer->Analog Voltage(0-5V)->ArduinoADC(A3)
Processing Stage: 10-sample moving average filter->Voltage Scaling(ADC to Volts) -> Voltage to PWM Conversion(0-5V to 0-255)
Output Stage: PWM Signal -> L293D Motor Driver -> DC Motor speed control
